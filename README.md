Title: Sentiment Analysis with Python: Website Text Evaluation Tool

**Description:**
Welcome to my Sentiment Analysis project implemented in Python. This project aims to analyze the sentiment of text extracted from websites, determining whether it is **positive, negative, or neutral**, while also providing a **summary of the website** details.

**Repository Overview:**
Inside this repository, you'll find two main files:

1. Main: This file contains the core logic for sentiment analysis.
2. App: Here, you'll find both the logic and the design components of the application.

**Tools and Libraries:**
This project leverages the **Streamlit library** for both designing the user interface and implementing the logic. Additionally, two key libraries, **TextBlob and Article,** are utilized for text processing and content extraction.

**Project Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to enhance my programming skills while delving into sentiment analysis. By analyzing website text and providing sentiment insights, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of natural language processing techniques.

Join me in exploring the world of sentiment analysis and website text evaluation through this Python project!
